task one 
A normal variable directly stores a data value (e.g., an integer or a character) in a specific memory location. When you access the variable, you read or modify the actual value stored at that memory address.

A pointer, on the other hand, stores the memory address of another variable rather than the data itself. To access or modify the value, you first use the pointer to get the address, then read or write the value at that address via dereferencing
